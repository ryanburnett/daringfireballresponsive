				<p>I think what he&#8217;s saying here is that the Chinese stole Apple technology, copied it, and are now flooding the Chinese market with phones based on that stolen tech.

				<p>In the wake of yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">terrible no good very bad earnings warning</a>, a bunch of people have been arguing with me on Twitter that Tim Cook is at fault for greedily raising prices to increase profits. I&#8217;ve been arguing since last year with the iPhone X that Apple isn&#8217;t raising prices, per se, but rather is making more expensive products.</p>

				<p>But as this thread on Twitter with &#8220;Cremnob&#8221; shows, there shouldn&#8217;t even be any argument. Apple&#8217;s company-wide gross margins have been 37-38 percent for the last five years. Going back 10 years, there&#8217;s a bit more fluctuation, but the fluctuations were <em>higher</em>, peaking at 44 percent in 2012.</p>

				<p>And these are company-wide numbers. Apple&#8217;s Services revenue is growing quickly (as Apple is very happy to tell you &#8212; count how many times Tim Cook mentioned it in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">yesterday&#8217;s letter to shareholders</a>), and it seems like their margins on services are higher than on hardware. So if high-margin services revenue is growing but overall company gross margins are stable at 38 percent, that means their margins on hardware products like iPhone are actually shrinking.</p>

			<h6 class="dateline">Thursday,  3 January 2019</h6>

			<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/28/netflix-permanently-pulls-itunes-billing-for-new-users/">Manish Singh, reporting for VentureBeat</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Netflix is further distancing itself from Apple’s iTunes tax
					bracket. Earlier this year, the streaming giant enabled iOS users
					in more than two dozen markets to bypass the iTunes payment method
					as part of an experiment. The company now tells VentureBeat that
					it has concluded the experiment and has incorporated the change
					globally.</p>

				<p>“We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new
					members,” a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. Existing
					members, however, can continue to use iTunes as a method of
					payment, the spokesperson added.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>This is a big deal. Netflix is the top-grossing app in the App Store in the U.S. They might remain the top-grossing app, even, because users who have already signed up with iTunes billing can keep doing so. But it really tells you how fractious Apple&#8217;s relationship is with content providers if the most successful one on the platform stops supporting it. And keep in mind that Netflix has long had a special relationship with Apple, with an 85/15 cut from the start, not just after a year.</p>

			<p>If Apple wants to insist on a cut of in-app purchased subscription revenue, that&#8217;s their prerogative. What gets me, though, are the rules that prevent apps that eschew in-app purchases from telling users in plain language how to actually pay. Not only is Netflix not allowed to link to their website, they can&#8217;t even tell the user they need to go to netflix.com to sign up. <a href="/misc/2019/01/netflix-how-to-watch.png">This screen</a> from the current version of Netflix for iPad is as close as they get, and I&#8217;ll bet it was the result of tense negotiations with Apple. Again, Apple can make the rules &#8212; it&#8217;s their platform. But it&#8217;s just wrong that one of the rules is that apps aren&#8217;t allowed to explain the rules to users.</p>

			<p>Apple should be earning its share of in-app subscription revenue by competing on convenience, not confusion and obfuscation.</p>

			<p>Oh, and that &#8220;Help&#8221; button <a href="/misc/2019/01/netflix-how-to-watch.png">up in the corner of the Netflix launch screen</a> is interesting. Tap that button and you get the option to call Netflix customer support (over some VOIP system, not a real phone call). I tried that, was told the queue was &#8220;about 6 minutes&#8221;, and exactly 6 minutes and 11 seconds later I was speaking to a friendly support rep. I told him I was using the iPad app and trying to sign up, but couldn&#8217;t figure out how.</p>

			<p>He told me I need to go to netflix.com in my browser.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘On Netflix Pulling Out of iTunes Billing for New Users’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">&#9733;</a></p>

			<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday,  2 January 2019</h6>

			<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/06/18Apple-Revises-Third-Quarter-Guidance/">Apple&#8217;s last earnings warning before today&#8217;s, on 18 June 2002</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Apple today announced that it expects to generate revenues of
					about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion in the June quarter, down from
					previous guidance of about $1.6 billion. The lower-than-expected
					revenues are primarily due to soft demand in the consumer and
					creative markets such as advertising and publishing.
					Geographically, revenues in Europe and Japan have become
					particularly weak. The revenue shortfall is expected to be offset
					significantly by higher-than-expected gross margins primarily due
					to lower costs of some components. Accordingly, the Company has
					revised its earnings guidance to $.08 to $.10 per diluted share,
					compared to previous guidance of $.11 or slightly higher.</p>

				<p>“Like others in our industry, we are experiencing a slowdown in
					sales this quarter. As a result, we’re going to miss our revenue
					projections by around 10%, resulting in slightly lower profits,”
					said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve got some amazing new products
					in development, so we’re excited about the year ahead. As one of
					the few companies currently making a profit in the PC business, we
					remain very optimistic about Apple’s prospects for long-term
					growth.”</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>That&#8217;s it &#8212; that&#8217;s the entirety of this warning. Two paragraphs, under 200 words. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">Tim Cook&#8217;s &#8220;letter to investors&#8221; today</a> was about 1,400 words. Part of this is just the nature of Apple being an industry titan blue chip today vs. being an outlier in 2002. The iPod was Mac-only in June 2002. And just look at the numbers: their 10 percent adjustment was just $200 million in revenue. Apple adjusted revenue today by about $7 <em>billion</em> (and that was only 7 percent &#8212; less on a percentage basis than the 2002 warning).</p>

			<p>But man, delivering bad news was one area where Steve Jobs really shined in a way that Tim Cook just can&#8217;t. Look at the tight construction of that message from Apple in 2002. First paragraph: put out the numbers. Second paragraph: it&#8217;s an industry-wide problem, but Apple has &#8220;amazing new products&#8221; coming. And then the kicker, the dagger: &#8220;As one of the few companies currently making a profit in the PC business…&#8221;.</p>

			<p><em>We&#8217;ve got some short term bad news but don&#8217;t worry, we have this.</em>&#8221; And&#8230; out. Short and sweet. Rip off the bad news Band-Aid, express quiet confidence that Apple is in great shape, and that&#8217;s it. Message over.</p>

			<p>Even if Jobs were still around I don&#8217;t think Apple could get away with a message so short with today&#8217;s news. But Cook&#8217;s letter was just too long. There was no story to it, no narrative. It should have been something along these lines (paraphrasing for succinctness, obviously &#8212; well, <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1080716783923924993">maybe not obviously</a>):</p>

			<p><em>We all know the Chinese market is fucked up &#8212; half because China is China and half because of you-know-who&#8217;s dumbass trade war. This quarter that fucked-upped-ness hit iPhone harder than we expected. But China is the whole problem &#8212; everything else is noise. Customers around the world love the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, and iPhones account for 90 percent of the profits in the entire handset industry. We expect that to grow as our competitors struggle to differentiate themselves from each other.</em></p>

			<p>Boom, drop the mic.</p>

			<p>Jobs&#8217;s arrogance got him into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0511/032-apple-steve-jobs-nobody-loves-me.html#42b2b3c41d85">trouble</a> at times, but at other times it was his saving grace. One of the finest moments in Apple&#8217;s history, at least from a messaging standpoint, was the company&#8217;s response to the iPhone 4 antennagate controversy. That press conference was a masterstroke. But underlying its success were two things: (1) the story truly was vastly overblown &#8212; the iPhone 4 antenna did have a weakness but it was a terrific product overall; (2) Jobs knew this and took a &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I have to waste my time with this bullshit, but OK, I&#8217;ll explain it to you&#8221; attitude into dealing with it.</p>

			<p>I think Cook&#8217;s genuine and inherent humility holds Apple back on days like today. Apple needed less &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m sorry, let me explain</em>&#8221; and more &#8220;<em>Fuck you, this is bullshit, let me explain</em>&#8221;. What people took away from Cook&#8217;s letter and TV appearance today is that the iPhone laid a turd last quarter. Properly delivered, the takeaway should have been that China is crazy but the iPhone is still kicking the shit out of the entire rest of the handset industry and is only pulling further ahead.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Steve Jobs and Apple’s Last Previous Earnings Warning’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/steve_jobs_and_apples_last_previous_earnings_warning">&#9733;</a></p>

				<p>This Ben Thompson column from May 2017 is worth <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/05/apples_china_problem_wechat">a re-link</a> given <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">today&#8217;s no good very bad earnings warning</a>, which Tim Cook made clear was almost entirely about slow sales in China:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>That, though, is a long-term problem for Apple: what makes the
						iPhone franchise so valuable &#8212; and, I’d add, the fundamental
						factor that was missed by so many for so long &#8212; is that monopoly
						on iOS. For most of the world it is unimaginable for an iPhone
						user to upgrade to anything but another iPhone: there is too much
						of the user experience, too many of the apps, and, in some
						countries like the U.S., too many contacts on iMessage to even
						countenance another phone.</p>

					<p>None of that lock-in exists in China: Apple may be a de facto
						monopolist for most of the world, but in China the company is
						simply another smartphone vendor, and being simply another
						smartphone vendor is a hazardous place to be. To be clear, it’s
						not all bad: in China Apple still trades on status and luxury;
						unlike the rest of the world, though, the company has to earn it
						with every release, and that’s a bar both difficult to clear in
						the abstract and, given the last two iPhones, difficult to clear
						in reality.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>By Thompson&#8217;s logic the iPhone X should have done well in China, because it <em>looked</em> new, and the XS/XR would disappoint in China because they didn&#8217;t. And, well, here we are.</p>

				<p>Apple does make great hardware &#8212; hardware so good that to some extent it sells itself. But the core of Apple&#8217;s platforms are the OS&#8217;s &#8212; the software, not the hardware. I&#8217;d <em>much</em> rather run MacOS on a ThinkPad and iOS on a Pixel phone than run Windows on a MacBook Pro and Android on an iPhone XS. If the appeal of iPhone in China is only or even just mostly about the hardware &#8212; because the software that matters is WeChat (or anything else that is cross-platform), not iOS and its native exclusive ecosystem &#8212; then China is never going to be a consistent market for Apple. It could be (and remains today) a lucrative market for Apple, but if all that matters is the hardware, Apple products are going to fluctuate sales-wise in China in ways they don&#8217;t in any other country.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m sure Cook had to reissue all aspects of their adjusted guidance for legal reasons, but the only one that is off is revenue, and it&#8217;s off by a lot: $7 billion from the middle of Apple&#8217;s projected range, and $5 billion from the lower bound.</p>

			<p>This is bad news, pure and simple, and for Apple, truly extraordinary. The last time Apple issued an earnings warning <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/06/18Apple-Revises-Third-Quarter-Guidance/">was in June 2002</a> &#8212; which is so long ago that it predates Daring Fireball <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2002/08/baby_needs_a_new_pair_of_processors">by two months</a>.</p>

			<p>Cook:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we
					did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration,
					particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue
					shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our
					year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater
					China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.</p>

				<p>China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The
					government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was
					the second lowest in the last 25 years.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;OK, it&#8217;s just China&#8221;, except that China is Apple&#8217;s only hope for iPhone sales growth. The truth seems obvious: Apple reached peak iPhone unit sales a few years ago, and now that they&#8217;ve peaked, when something goes wrong in a major market like China, it&#8217;s going to result in an overall decline in sales.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>We believe the economic environment in China has been further
					impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Translation: Donald Trump.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the
					vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in
					some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as
					we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some
					markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are
					other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including
					consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US
					dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking
					advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery
					replacements.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>That&#8217;s an eye-catching admission &#8212; it sure makes it sound like the old way of handling battery degradation (throttling performance to keep the iPhone working at all, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/iphone_battery_throttling">but not informing the user what was happening or why</a>)  was intended to drive people to buy new phones. I don&#8217;t think it was, but it effectively became a side effect Apple was happy with until it blew up into a controversy. <a href="https://twitter.com/cnbcnow/status/1080580947865714689?s=21">Cook is even making this same point in an interview on CNBC now</a>. I think that&#8217;s the wrong way to play it &#8212; Apple should be proud that you can get two or three extra years of great performance from an older iPhone with a relatively inexpensive battery replacement, not pointing fingers at the program as a reason for slower sales this quarter.</p>

			<hr />

			<p>The problem iPhone sales face is not a lack of innovation. But I&#8217;m sure the interwebs are already full of arguments that this is the reason. People have been arguing that year-over-year iPhones weren&#8217;t innovative enough every single year since the iPhone 3G, with the possible exception of the iPhone 4 in 2010, which introduced an obviously amazing retina display and an all-new vastly superior industrial design. Except instead of complaining about &#8220;innovation&#8221; with the iPhone 4, the same critics just made a mountain out of the antennagate molehill.</p>

			<p>iPhone sales have effectively peaked for two reasons. First, Apple ran out of new markets to conquer years ago. The iPhone is effectively available worldwide. The astounding go-go growth of the iPhone in the early years was largely about their steady expansion into new countries around the world. <a href="http://www.mattrichman.net/takeaways-from-apples-q4-2011/">Matt Richman put the insane growth of the iPhone in the early years into perspective seven years ago</a>:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>In 2009, Apple sold more iPhones than it did in 2007 and 2008
					combined. In 2010, Apple sold more iPhones than it did in 2007,
					2008, and 2009 combined. Last year, Apple sold 93.1 million
					iPhones, slightly more than it did in in 2007, 2008, 2009, and
					2010 combined. The pattern continued.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>But there&#8217;s a limit on the number of people in the world who (a) want an iPhone and (b) can afford one, and the iPhone reached that 3-4 years ago. A bad economy in China significantly shrinks the number of people worldwide who can afford one. They&#8217;re much in the position Microsoft got to with Windows and PCs &#8212; they&#8217;re no longer an upstart growth company and are now a massively profitable blue chip.</p>

			<p>The other factor is that the modern &#8212; that is to say post-iPhone &#8212; smartphone market is 11 years old. It&#8217;s maturing, and in a mature market people replace devices less frequently. In the same way MacBooks last for 4-5 years or more for many (most?) people, iPhones now last 3-4 years easily. Durable hardware with future-proof chip performance, combined with Apple&#8217;s redoubled effort to make sure iOS 12 runs well on older hardware &#8212; these are good things for users and for the long-term reputation of the iPhone, but by definition they <em>lengthen</em> upgrade cycles.</p>

			<p>Apple could not have picked a worse quarter in which to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/apple-stop-reporting-unit-sales/">stop reporting iPhone unit sale numbers</a>. They should have picked a quarter when sales were higher than expected, or at least in line with expectations. Picking a quarter in which iPhone sales fell short will only fuel the notion that they&#8217;ve stopped reporting unit sales because they have something to hide. Given how far short iPhone revenue is for this quarter, even I find myself wondering if that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re changing this policy now. It&#8217;s un-Apple-like to make a long-term change for short-term reasons, but you can&#8217;t ignore the optics on the timing.</p>

			<hr />

			<p>I called &#8220;bullshit&#8221; (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/31/the-talk-show-239">literally the word I used on my latest podcast</a>) on the last two months of &#8220;<em>iPhone sales are slower than Apple expected</em>&#8221; stories and clearly I was wrong. I still think most of the reports were bullshit &#8212; particularly the ones based on reports from Asian suppliers &#8212; just bullshit that happened to turn out right for once, like a stopped watch getting the time right twice a day.</p>

			<p>One analyst who definitely got it right, though, was Rod Hall at Goldman Sachs. His research note downgrading Apple back on November 20 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-stock-price-goldman-sachs-downgrade-iphone-xr-price-2018-11">looks remarkably prescient today</a>.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s Terrible No Good Very Bad Earnings Warning’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">&#9733;</a></p>

					<p>Best known to today’s viewers for playing the serious, often surly but always hilarious Marty Funkhouser on “Curb Your Enthusiasm”, Einstein was a foil for its creator-star Larry David. He appeared in nearly two dozen episodes of the series dating from 2004 to the most recent season.</p>

					<p>Einstein’s younger brother, actor-director Albert Brooks, tweeted today, “R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein. A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.”</p>

				<p>Super Dave Osborne was one of my favorite bits in the 80s. He was one of the best recurring guests on Late Night With David Letterman. He played Super Dave so straight — I always wondered how many people never realized it was a spoof.</p>

				<p>Fascinating piece in The New Yorker by Patrick Radden Keefe:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>“The Apprentice” was built around a weekly series of business challenges. At the end of each episode, Trump determined which competitor should be “fired.” But, as Braun explained, Trump was frequently unprepared for these sessions, with little grasp of who had performed well. Sometimes a candidate distinguished herself during the contest only to get fired, on a whim, by Trump. When this happened, Braun said, the editors were often obliged to “reverse engineer” the episode, scouring hundreds of hours of footage to emphasize the few moments when the exemplary candidate might have slipped up, in an attempt to assemble an artificial version of history in which Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip decision made sense. During the making of “The Apprentice,” Burnett conceded that the stories were constructed in this way, saying, “We know each week who has been fired, and, therefore, you’re editing in reverse.” Braun noted that President Trump’s staff seems to have been similarly forced to learn the art of retroactive narrative construction, adding, “I find it strangely validating to hear that they’re doing the same thing in the White House.”</p>

					<p>For 10 years, I worked as a cable tech in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Those 10 years, the apartments, the McMansions, the customers, the bugs and snakes, the telephone poles, the traffic, the cold and heat and rain, have blurred together in my mind. Even then, I wouldn’t remember a job from the day before unless there was something remarkable about it. Remarkable is subjective and changes with every day spent witnessing what people who work in offices will never see &#8212; their co-workers at home during the weekday, the American id in its underpants, wondering if it remembered to delete the browsing history.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve long been obsessed by portable battery packs &#8212; I&#8217;ve bought way more of them than I need over the years, because I&#8217;m always looking for one that&#8217;s just right. Someone on Twitter just asked what my current favorite is, and I thought it&#8217;d be worth sharing: it&#8217;s Anker&#8217;s PowerCore II 6700 &#8212; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07211V9XG/">$24 at Amazon</a>.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m only interested in battery packs that are comfortably pocketable. This one is the best balance I&#8217;ve found between size/weight, battery capacity, and charging speed (both input and output are at 10W &#8212; a lot of smaller battery packs only do 5W). Really good build quality and the round edges make it feel much better in a jeans pocket. Pair it with a short Lightning cable and you&#8217;re set.</p>

				<p>Biggest downside is that like almost all battery packs, it charges via Micro USB. I get around that by keeping only <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=18789">3-in-1 (Micro USB/USB-C/Lightning) charging cables</a> in my computer bag.</p>

				<p>My thanks to SketchParty TV for sponsoring last week on DF. SketchParty TV is a fun, fast, drawing-and-guessing game for Apple TV.</p>

				<p>Using the native tvOS app &#8212; or AirPlay Mirroring &#8212; turn your HDTV into a Wi-Fi drawing canvas and high-tech party game. Think Pictionary but without anything to clean up. We&#8217;ve been playing with family over the holiday break, and it&#8217;s a lot of fun and super easy to get going.</p>

				<p>All you need is an Apple TV plus an iPad or iPhone &#8212; and it works <em>great</em> with Apple Pencil. Features include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Thousands of words to draw, localized in 7 languages.</li>
					<li>Several kid-friendly word lists.</li>
					<li>Built-in custom word list editor.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>And I think this is worth pointing out: there are <em>no</em> in-app purchases. You pay $4.99 once and the whole game is yours. Well worth it. We&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with it already, and it&#8217;s a great idea if you&#8217;re hosting a New Year&#8217;s Eve party, especially a family party with kids and adults.</p>

				<p>Kurt Wagner, writing for Recode:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Back in May, at the height of Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica
						privacy scandal, the company made a timely announcement: Facebook
						users would soon be able to clear the browsing history connected
						to their Facebook profile, meaning that the company would no
						longer link users to the apps and websites they visited off of the
						social network.</p>

					<p>The product, called “Clear History,” got a lot of attention. Not
						only is browsing data important &#8212; Facebook uses it to target
						people with advertising &#8212; but CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Clear
						History himself during Facebook’s annual developer conference.
						Clear History was an olive branch meant to show everyone how
						serious Facebook is about privacy. [&#8230;]</p>

					<p>As it turns out, clearing your browser history was harder to
						implement than Facebook expected. It’s been more than seven months
						since Zuckerberg’s announcement and Facebook hasn’t mentioned
						Clear History since.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>I don&#8217;t think it was hard, per se, but that the entire announcement was bullshit intended to distract people from the biggest privacy scandal in company history &#8212; and Facebook is a company riddled with privacy scandals.</p>

				<p>This is what my idea of regulation would entail: every user of every social network should be able to see (and easily find) the entirety of what the network knows about them, and delete any and all of it whenever they want.</p>

				<p>Max Fisher, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Every other Tuesday morning, several dozen Facebook employees
						gather over breakfast to come up with the rules, hashing out what
						the site’s two billion users should be allowed to say. The
						guidelines that emerge from these meetings are sent out to
						7,500-plus moderators around the world. (After publication of this
						article, Facebook said it had increased that number to around
						15,000.)</p>

					<p>The closely held rules are extensive, and they make the company a
						far more powerful arbiter of global speech than has been publicly
						recognized or acknowledged by the company itself, The New York
						Times has found.</p>

					<p>The Times was provided with more than 1,400 pages from the
						rulebooks by an employee who said he feared that the company was
						exercising too much power, with too little oversight &#8212; and making
						too many mistakes.</p>

					<p>An examination of the files revealed numerous gaps, biases and
						outright errors. As Facebook employees grope for the right
						answers, they have allowed extremist language to flourish in some
						countries while censoring mainstream speech in others.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Are there Facebook apologists remaining? It&#8217;s very clear that Facebook&#8217;s top priority was and remains growth at all costs. The side effects of what they&#8217;ve enabled &#8212; allowing formerly fringe hate groups to gather, organize, and fuel each others&#8217; hatred, forming effective like-minded communities &#8212; should have been obvious all along. No one forced them to scale their platform worldwide faster than they could police it. They chose to do so for profit. It&#8217;s clear they have almost no control over it.</p>

				<p>Facebook is, in my opinion, the most dangerous company in the world, and ought to be broken up and then severely regulated. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/07/hill-facebook-emails">Again I say</a>, Facebook is to privacy and civil discourse what Enron was to accounting.</p>

						the full game that was still recognisably Fortnite, that played
						the same way, that run the same code and allowed users to buddy up
						with their friends running on console and PC. Recently, Epic took
						the mobile version of Fortnite to the next level; the latest iOS
						devices run the game smoothly at 60 frames per second, just like
						their console equivalents &#8212; and the story of how that became
						possible is absolutely fascinating.</p>

					<p>The truth is that aside from minor modifications to unlock the
						frame-rate and add the option to the game&#8217;s menu system, no
						substantial code revamp was required at all. Fortnite on the
						latest iPhones runs at 60 frames per second simply by virtue of
						the new Apple A12 Bionic silicon - or rather its increased power
						and crucially, its superior thermal performance.</p>

					<p>“But it can be slimmer!” No one was asking for that.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Regular readers know that I&#8217;m fully on Team AirPods &#8212; I honestly don&#8217;t miss the headphone jack on my iPhone or iPad Pro at all. But I sympathize with those who miss it. You certainly can&#8217;t argue with the simplicity angle.</p>

				<p>But on the thinness front &#8212; there really are engineering issues related to the space the headphone jack takes up. I&#8217;m not going to say Apple &#8220;couldn&#8217;t&#8221; make an edge-to-edge iPad Pro or iPhone XS or XR with a headphone jack, because I don&#8217;t know that for a fact. But look at the XR&#8217;s off-center Lightning port. If they couldn&#8217;t center the Lightning port, I think there&#8217;s a good chance they literally could not fit a headphone jack there. When I asked Apple about the lack of a headphone jack on the new iPad Pros, their answer was simple: &#8220;Space.&#8221;</p>

				<p>My thanks to Agenda for sponsoring this week at DF. Note-taking apps are near and dear to my heart. It&#8217;s hard thing to do well, and a <em>really</em> hard thing to do originally. Agenda does it both really well and in an original way. Agenda is date-focused, which is different than anything I&#8217;ve seen before. If you&#8217;ve never had a notes app click for you, Agenda might. By linking dates &#8212; and, if you want, calendar events &#8212; to notes, Agenda has a sense of past, present, and future.</p>

				<p>They started with a great Mac app &#8212; so good that it was the only Mac app of any kind to win an Apple Design Award in 2018. They then added an iOS app, which syncs seemlessly with the Mac app using CloudKit. Markdown formatting, checklists, true native apps, great UI style, an active user community &#8212; yes to all the above.</p>

				<p>And, now, Agenda has just added support for images and file attachments &#8212; their most-requested feature. Agenda is great for everything from meeting notes to travel journals. It&#8217;s free to download and use forever, on both Mac and iOS, with premium features available via <a href="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/a-cash-cow-is-on-the-agenda-138a11995595">a truly unique in-app purchase system</a>, <em>not</em> a subscription.</p>

				<p>Check it out. They even have an absolutely perfect icon. Agenda is truly a great app.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>On Wednesday, a man named Peter Logan emailed BuzzFeed News to
						share some strange things he noticed using Google&#8217;s Street View
						feature and Zillow. He realized that when the third thief, who
						opened the glitter-fart bomb inside her home, went outside to
						throw it out, her side yard and outdoor space seemed to be right
						next door to Cici&#8217;s house.</p>

					<p>After watching the video several times much more closely, he
						realized that the second package thief&#8217;s car, a black Ford
						Focus, was also parked outside Cici&#8217;s house in several other
						shots. Zooming in, Logan was able to read the address on the
						third thief&#8217;s house, google it, and confirm that it was indeed
						Cici&#8217;s neighbor, leading him, he wrote, to &#8220;come to the opinion
						that the whole video was a put-on, that the package thieves were
						in on the gag.&#8221; [&#8230;]</p>

				<p>Related to John Giannandrea&#8217;s leadership of Apple&#8217;s AI and ML teams:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>We recently tested four smart speakers by asking Alexa, Siri,
						Google Assistant, and Cortana 800 questions each. Google Assistant
						was able to answer 88% of them correctly vs. Siri at 75%, Alexa at
						73%, and Cortana at 63%. Last year, Google Assistant was able to
						answer 81% correctly vs. Siri (Feb-18) at 52%, Alexa at 64%, and
						Cortana at 56%. [&#8230;]</p>

					<p>Over a 12-month period, Google Home improved by 7 percentage
						points, Echo by 9 points, Siri (9-month) by 22 points, and Cortana
						by 7 points in terms of questions answered correctly.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>And:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>It’s also important to note that HomePod’s underperformance in
						many areas is due to the fact that Siri’s ability is limited on
						HomePod as compared to your iPhone. Many Information and Commerce
						questions are met with, “I can’t get the answer to that on
						HomePod.” This is partially due to Apple’s apparent positioning of
						HomePod not as a “smart speaker,” but as a home speaker you can
						interact with using your voice with Siri onboard.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>There&#8217;s no &#8220;apparent&#8221; about it &#8212; that&#8217;s exactly how Apple has positioned HomePod. So part of the gap between HomePod and Google Home is in questions Siri can answer on other devices.</p>

				<p>Apple&#8217;s biggest problem with Siri will soon be convincing people that it has improved enough to be worth trying again. Siri faces a &#8220;boy who cried wolf&#8221; problem &#8212; except instead of lying, people stopped trying it because it sucked.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Apple today announced that John Giannandrea has been named to the

						Learning and Artificial Intelligence Strategy. He joined Apple in
						April 2018.</p>

					<p>Giannandrea oversees the strategy for AI and Machine Learning

				</blockquote>

				<p>Giannandrea, you will recall, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/03/apple-hires-former-google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea/">came to Apple from Google</a>, where he was in charge of AI and search.

Apple&#8217;s goal, obviously, is to meet or exceed Google in these areas &#8212; which is to say to lead the industry.</p>

						been shut since Wednesday night, as devices have been repeatedly

					<p>Sussex Police said it was not terror-related but a &#8220;deliberate

						110,000 passengers on 760 flights were due to fly on Thursday.
						Disruption could last &#8220;several days&#8221;.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Drones are super cool, and it&#8217;s amazing what footage talented drone operators can capture. But I keep wondering how long they can remain legal. This massive travel disruption at Gatwick is bad enough &#8212; I can only imagine how furious the passengers are whose flights have been grounded by this stunt.</p>

				<p>But how long until someone like this uses a drone to commit violence?</p>

				<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had forgotten about this story from August: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/04/americas/venezuela-maduro/index.html">Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro survived an assassination attempt by drones rigged with explosives</a>.</p>

				<p>Staggering report by New York Times reporters Gabriel J.X. Dance, Michael LaForgia, and Nicholas Confessore:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The exchange was intended to benefit everyone. Pushing for
						explosive growth, Facebook got more users, lifting its advertising
						revenue. Partner companies acquired features to make their
						products more attractive. Facebook users connected with friends
						across different devices and websites. But Facebook also assumed
						extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2
						billion users &#8212; control it has wielded with little transparency
						or outside oversight.</p>

					<p>Facebook allowed Microsoft’s Bing search engine to see the names
						of virtually all Facebook users’ friends without consent, the
						records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read
						Facebook users’ private messages.</p>

					<p>The social network permitted Amazon to obtain users’ names and
						contact information through their friends, and it let Yahoo view
						streams of friends’ posts as recently as this summer, despite
						public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years
						earlier.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>It&#8217;s tempting to file this under &#8220;<em>Yeah, yeah, another Facebook privacy story, blah blah blah</em>&#8221;, but this report is truly scathing, and worth a thorough read. Regulators should start thinking about breaking this company up.</p>

				<p>And these other companies that used this data from Facebook need to answer for this. This is immoral, if not illegal, and everyone knows it.</p>

			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>I really like my new 11-inch iPad Pro. I’m using it more than I’ve used an iPad in a long time, especially for reading. It’s my favorite device for reading ever, and I read a lot. But it has been driving me nuts that it doesn’t support a split on-screen keyboard.</p>

				<p>I tweeted about this a few weeks ago and a few people replied with the answer that the new iPad Pros have a different on-screen keyboard than the non-Pro iPads, one that more closely resembles the key layout of a hardware keyboard. It’s true that the keyboard is different, but that doesn’t explain why you can’t split it. Why not allow it to be split and revert to the same split keyboard as on non-Pro iPads? What makes this more baffling is that the bigger the iPad is, the more likely it is that you need a split keyboard — and the iPad Pros are the biggest iPads Apple has made. I want to type with my thumbs, iPhone-style, and can’t, because my iPad is too big. And I have relatively large hands <em>and</em> I’m using the 11-inch iPad Pro, not the 13-inch one. I’m not even sure Craig “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/12/17/ep-176">Fleshy Palms</a>” Hockenberry could thumb-type on a 13-inch iPad Pro.</p>

				<p>The bottom line is that because I want to thumb-type, I type better on-screen with my iPhone than I do my iPad, <em>and</em> I can type better on an old iPad than my new one that cost $1,000. This is just baffling to me — so much so that until I found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207521">Apple’s support document confirming that the split keyboard is not available on 11-inch or bigger iPad Pros</a> that I thought maybe the problem was me not knowing how to turn it on.</p>

				<p>Did not wake up today thinking I’d be linking to a TMZ story about Alfonso Ribeiro, but here we are. This story feels like 2018 in a nutshell.</p>

				<p>Zac Hall, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Apple Music Connect appears to slowly be going the way of iTunes
						Ping. Apple has started notifying Apple Music artists that it is
						removing the ability for artists to post content to Apple Music
						Connect, and previously posted Apple Music Connect content is
						being removed from the For You section and Artist Pages in Apple
						Music. Connect content will still be viewable through search
						results on Apple Music, but Apple is removing artist-submitted
						Connect posts from search in May. [&#8230;]</p>

					<p>Apple also says “Connect posts from artists are no longer
						supported” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206651">on this support
							document</a>.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Two areas where Apple has never really succeeded: serious gaming and social media. Two areas where Steve Jobs never seemed interested: serious gaming and social media. I just don&#8217;t think either of these things are in Apple&#8217;s DNA.</p>

				<p>You can argue, of course, that the distinction between casual and serious gaming is arbitrary, and that Apple is killing it in casual gaming on iOS. But I think people who play serious games see a very clear distinction, and Apple isn&#8217;t part of that world.</p>
