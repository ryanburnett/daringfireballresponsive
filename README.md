## Installation

### HTML
There's only one HTML change:

Replacing:

```
> <meta name="viewport" content="width=500, minimum-scale=0.45" />
```

...with:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### CSS

The rest of the changes are all in `fireball_screen.css`

Given the high amount of edits it's probably easiest to just do a full copy and paste rather than cherry picking each change
